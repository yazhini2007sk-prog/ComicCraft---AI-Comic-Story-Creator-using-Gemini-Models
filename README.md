# ComicCraft — AI Comic Story Creator using Gemini Models

**AI-powered web application that turns a simple text prompt into a complete comic book
— outline, story, dialogue, and illustrations — exportable as a PDF.**

Built with **FastAPI** · **Google Gemini** · **FPDF** · optional **Stable Diffusion (Hugging Face)**.

</div>

## What it does

1. You enter a story idea (plus optional characters, setting, tone, art style, panel count).
2. **Gemini Flash** builds a structured multi-panel comic outline.
3. **Gemini Pro** (auto-falls back to Flash on quota blocks) expands it into narration, dialogue, and image prompts.
4. Each panel is illustrated by the **Gemini image model** (or Stable Diffusion when `HF_API_KEY` is set).
5. Preview everything on the web page and **download the full comic as a PDF**.

> Only a **Google Gemini API key** is required — no Hugging Face key needed.
